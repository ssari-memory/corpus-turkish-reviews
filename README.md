# Abstract
Sentiment analysis and opinion mining have an important role to trace consumer behavior. With the recent advances in machine learning techniques, this issue has been addressed and come a long way in English. However, in agglutinative languages such as Turkish, it has been still one of the hot topics. In this study, we compare several classification methods and deep learning methods to make a sentiment analysis for Turkish reviews that we have collected from Google Play. We have 87.30% prediction accuracy for multinomial Naive Bayes and 95.87% prediction accuracy for deep learning model. We have significant results both from the machine learning classifiers and the deep learning model. While there is no difference between machine learning classifiers when we use different vectorizers, there is a difference when we build a deep learning model to predict target value. This model can also be applied to any data from Twitter, Facebook, or any other microblogging.
